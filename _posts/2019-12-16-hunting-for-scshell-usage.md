## Introduction
In today's post we're going to create detections and hunt for the usage of the recent lateral movement technique called [SCShell](https://github.com/Mr-Un1k0d3r/SCShell).

In a nutshell, the SCShell technique is born from the limitation of lateral movement attacks like remote service creation that required the attacker to drop files on the remote filesystem. Raphael Mudge's post [Covert Lateral Movement with High-Latency C&C ](https://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2014/04/30/lateral-movement-with-high-latency-cc/) explains how it is possible to create remote services to execute cobaltstrike's beacon after transferring it to the target's host.
The aforementioned technique leaves considerable traces on the target host:

* A new service is created (Event ID [4697](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4697));
* The cobaltstrike beacon is dropped on the target's filesystem.

For reference, my post on [lateral movement](https://riccardoancarani.github.io//assets/2019-10-04-lateral-movement-megaprimer/#remote-service-creation) explains how to use remote service creation to compromise remote machines.
SCShell, however, does not create a new service but modifies the binary path of an existing one to execute code.
At an high level, the flow of the technique is the following:

* Opens the remote services manager using `OpenSCManagerW`:

* Opens the target service (which needs to be specified beforehand) using `OpenService`:

* Saves the old binary path used by the service, in order to restore after the command is executed.

* **Changes the configuration** of the service using `ChangeServiceConfigA`:

* **The new binary, by default, is `C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /c` followed by the command supplied by the user;**
* Starts the target service;
* Restores the previous configuration.

##Â Lab Setup

The lab I used to practice with these detections is fairly simple:
* Windows Server 2012 as a target host;
* My macOS as attacking machine (RAM ain't free mannn)
* Elasticsearch and Kibana deployed within Docker containers running on my host.

## Hunting Time

Having analysed how the technique works, in my opinion the two actions where we can build detection on are:

* The configuration of a service is changed

AND

* The binary file of a service gets replaced with `cmd.exe`

I did a couple of experiments to build detection for this technique and I started using osquery's `service` table to look at changes made to service's configuration. What I did was creating a query pack in differential mode:

```
SELECT name, path FROM services WHERE path LIKE '%cmd.exe%'
```

Differential mode means that osquery will output only the differences bewteen the last query and the current one. It seemed ideal and the output was something like the following:

I quickly realised how unreliable was this approach, with standard tables like `services` osquery takes only a snapshot of the current system's status. SCShell however changed the configuration of the target service only for a couple of seconds, and therefore to have robust detection you would have to schedule the aforementioned query very frequently, with a consequent load on the monitored system.  
osquery overcomes this by using his [eventing framework](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/pubsub-framework/), that allows you to queue events and send them as a result in the next scheduled query. Usually tables that ends with `_events` support the eveenting framework, but unfortunately for us, the `service` one doesn't.

I decided to switch to Windows event log analysis using Winlogbeat and Elasticsearch; more specifically monitoring the event [4657 - A registry value was modified](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4657) and analysing the value of the changed registry key allowed me to build a quite robust detection.

Before being able to receive event IDs 4657, you need to enable registry auditing. Why registry? Because every service's configuration is stored under the registrty hive `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`:

Monitoring changes in the registry under the Services hive would allow us to spot when a remote attacker will attempt to modify the configuration of a service.

To enable registry auditing you can follow a tutorial like [this one](http://kb.gfi.com/articles/SkyNet_Article/KBID002902).
After setting up auditing for the registry keys, we can start hunting for the attack.

Let's perform the technique from out attacking machine:

![](/assets/2019-12-16-hunting-for-scshell-usage/278e7f4f8ec3016bb95f71b9816e6877.png)

From out Kibana dashboard we can perform the following query:

```
(winlog.event_id:"4657" AND winlog.event_data.ProcessName:"C\:\\Windows\\System32\\services.exe" AND "cmd.exe\ \/c" AND "MACHINE\\SYSTEM")
```

adn as it is possible to see, we obtained some useful results:

![](/assets/2019-12-16-hunting-for-scshell-usage/daaed4ae545a5651a46ad678c45037d1.png)

Inspecting the query's output we can see that the registry key value associated with the `Audiosrv` service were changed with a `whoami` command.

Additionally, SCShell by default uses the `XblAuthManager` service as a target, it would be possible to filter only for that service if the proposed query generates too much false positives.

As an addition, this is the [sigma](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma) rule to detect this attack:

```

## Caveats

As every detection, it's not perfect and catches only the default behaviour of the tool. In fact it would be possible to execute different commands instead of `cmd.exe` like `powershell.exe`, any other LOLBin used for code execution (`msbuild` etc..) or a webdav path that points to an executable. It would be then necessary to modify the query accordingly (not a very difficult task, left to the reader because of laziness)

A couple of points before finishing:

* It's possible to do the same with sysmon events, but Winlogbeat parses correctly every field and allowed me to extract the binary path.
* Study your tools, study your techniques, understand that there is a difference between the two.
* Auditing the services hive may generate a shit ton of logs? I don't know.
