My name is Riccardo and I currently work as a security consultant at F-Secure Consulting.
The main activities that I'm involved in are:

- Infrastructure pentesting
- Active Directory Security assessments
- Web app pentesting
- [insert other boring stuff consultants have to do]

You can find me on twitter at @dottor_morte or LinkedIn!

My GitHub profile kinda sucks because the interesting stuff cannot be released yet
